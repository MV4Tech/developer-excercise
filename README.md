 - Briefly introduce the project and its purpose.
This project entails the development of a Groceries Shop till system capable of handling various types of
fruits and vegetables with special pricing deals. The system, implemented in a language of choice, allows
for defining supported items and configuring special deals like "2 for 3" and "buy 1 get 1 half price".
Users can scan a list of items and receive a numeric bill reflecting any applicable discounts. 
The solution aims for clarity, test coverage, reusability, modularity, and documentation, offering
flexibility for future extensions and demonstrating key software development concepts.
